    "2. $\\mathbb{E}[u_i | X_i] = 0$: This one is shaky. As $X_i$ increases, for example, $Y_i$ becomes less predictable (the 5-day incubation time was a rough estimate, and one that's liable to break down as more and more people get the virus.) But there's no easy way around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $(X_i, Y_i)$ are i.i.d. draws from their joint distribution: Certainly there wasn't any systematic sampling done (and the future 5 days away is unknowable when each $X_i$ was \"sampled.\") But perhaps the cutoff rule we used (there are only time periods of interest; before Mar. 11, and after) is too coarse. \n",
